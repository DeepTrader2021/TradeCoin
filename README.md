Comments:
I build a base framework, including training(2017-2019), dev(2019-2020), testing(2020-2021), ploting with off-line history kline data. Both spot and future are implemented. Results on spot gain near 200% reward. Results on future are interesting and need my efforts. Now I'm trying to play a better future trader.
